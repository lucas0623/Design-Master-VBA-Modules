For a long time, there has been a notable lack of reliable and systematic tools for design calculations using Excel spreadsheets. This gap often results in a prolonged design process and diminished design quality.

This excel add-in addressed the issue by streamlining the daily design process with calculation using user's excel spreadsheets. It offers tools to expedite data processing, transitioning seamlessly from structural analysis results to the preparation of design reports. This enhanced process is divided into three main functions:- 
1. Importing structural analysis result data from structural analysis software (SAP2000 and GSA);
2. Extracting relevant design data from the imported information based on user specifications;
3. Performing bulk design calculations using your own spreadsheets and exporting the results in PDF format.
